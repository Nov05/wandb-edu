# Learn Effective MLOps: Model Development

This repository contains materials for our [MLOps Course](https://www.wandb.courses/courses/effective-mlops-model-development)

Bringing machine learning models to production is challenging, with a continuous iterative lifecycle that consists of many complex components. 

Having a disciplined, flexible and collaborative process - an effective MLOps system - is crucial to enabling velocity and rigor, and building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that continually delivers production-ready ML models and services.

Lesson 2: [04_refactor_baseline_02.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/Nov05/wandb-edu/blob/main/mlops-001/lesson2/04_refactor_baseline_02.ipynb), [04_refactor_baseline_03_ubuntu-wsl.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/Nov05/wandb-edu/blob/6c232b0cd4c46863e056425d3d7c8bd20c342189/mlops-001/lesson2/04_refactor_baseline_03_ubuntu-wsl.ipynb)  

„Äê**Caution**„Äëfile `conda-environment.yaml` in Lesson 2 doesn't work for Windows (pytorch just doesn **NOT** support Windows). You can install Ubuntu WSL and [set up the enviroment with miniconda](https://www.how2shout.com/linux/install-miniconda-on-ubuntu-22-04-lts-jammy-linux/) there.

If you run into **issue** `Could not load library libcudnn_cnn_infer.so.8. Error: libcuda.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Please make sure libcudnn_cnn_infer.so.8 is in your library path`, [add the following config](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/libcudnn-cnn-infer-so-8-library-can-not-found/164661).   
> As discussed in this issue 155 it is just a matter to add this in the `.bashrc`:  
> `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/wsl/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`  
> Be sure that your library is in /usr/lib/wsl/lib, to see it you can run  
> `ldconfig -p | grep cuda`   
> 
You can check the config with command `$cat ~/.bashrc`.  
[Install text editor](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/gedit) with command `$sudo apt-get install gedit`.
