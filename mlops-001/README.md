# Learn Effective MLOps: Model Development

This repository contains materials for our [MLOps Course](https://www.wandb.courses/courses/effective-mlops-model-development)

Bringing machine learning models to production is challenging, with a continuous iterative lifecycle that consists of many complex components. 

Having a disciplined, flexible and collaborative process - an effective MLOps system - is crucial to enabling velocity and rigor, and building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that continually delivers production-ready ML models and services.

Lesson 1: [01_EDA.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/Nov05/wandb-edu/blob/main/mlops-001/lesson1/01_EDA.ipynb), [02_Split.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/Nov05/wandb-edu/blob/main/mlops-001/lesson1/02_Split.ipynb), [03_Baseline.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/Nov05/wandb-edu/blob/main/mlops-001/lesson1/03_Baseline.ipynb)  
Lesson 2: [04_refactor_baseline_02.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/Nov05/wandb-edu/blob/main/mlops-001/lesson2/04_refactor_baseline_02.ipynb), [04_refactor_baseline_03_ubuntu-wsl.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/Nov05/wandb-edu/blob/6c232b0cd4c46863e056425d3d7c8bd20c342189/mlops-001/lesson2/04_refactor_baseline_03_ubuntu-wsl.ipynb)  

Caution: the file `conda-environment.yaml` in Lesson 2 doesn't work for Windows (pytorch just doesn't support windows). You can install Ubuntu WSL and [set up the enviroment with miniconda](https://www.how2shout.com/linux/install-miniconda-on-ubuntu-22-04-lts-jammy-linux/) there.
